I am [Miren Lur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirenlurbarquintorre/), a mathematician specialized in Machine Learning, currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I am passionate about the healthcare sector, particularly in medical image analysis and computer vision.

While Python is my primary coding language, my academic and professional journey has exposed me to a diverse set of programming languages, including C++, Matlab, R, MS Excel Macros (VBA), and SQL.

In my GitHub profile, you will find a collection of projects I have been diligently working on:
