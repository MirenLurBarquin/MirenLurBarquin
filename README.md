### Bio & Projects 🔍

I am [Miren Lur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirenlurbarquintorre/), a mathematician specialized in Machine Learning, currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I am passionate about the healthcare sector, particularly in medical image analysis and computer vision. I am currently a Research Assistant at the [Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance (DRCMR)](https://www.drcmr.dk/) in the [Microstructure and Plasticity Group](https://map.compute.dtu.dk/).

While Python is my primary coding language, my academic and professional journey has exposed me to a diverse set of languages and tools, including C++, Matlab, R, MS Excel Macros (VBA), and SQL.

On my GitHub profile, you will find a selection of projects I have been diligently working on, including:
