### Bio & Projects üîç

I am [Miren Lur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirenlurbarquintorre/), a Mathematician specialized in Machine Learning, currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Presently, I am professionally immersed in the green energy storage sector, focusing on electricity price and EV capacity forecasting for trading. Simultaneously, I am passionate about the healthcare sector, particularly in medical image analysis and computer vision.

While Python is my primary coding language, my academic and professional journey has exposed me to a diverse set of programming languages and tools, including C++, Matlab, R, MS Excel Macros (VBA), SQL and Dagster.

In my GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of projects I've been diligently working on:
